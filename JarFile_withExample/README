Run the algorithm:

1. Type in the terminal, in the directory of the MCEC.jar file:
>> java -jar MCECalgorithm.jar <<dataset-filename>>.csv [N] [optionClass] [MarkovLag]
      [N] - number of features per time point
			[optionClass] - boolean: TRUE = with classification; FALSE = without classification
			[MarkovLag] - boolean: TRUE = with Markov lag; FALSE = standard Early Classification

2. Six text files will be generated.

3. Run the Matlab script MCEC_program.m in the same directory as the text files in order to obtain the graphs.
